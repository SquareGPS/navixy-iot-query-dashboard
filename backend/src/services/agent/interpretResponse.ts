 * PURE — string in, AgentIntent out. No AWS import of any kind, no logger, no
 * side effects: that is what makes the single most fragile decision in this
 * feature testable with no client, no mock and no DI seam. The caller
 * (bedrockAgent.ts) owns every log line and every S3 byte.
 *
 * Strategy: trailer-first, heuristic-as-fallback, from day one. fromTrailer
 * returns null against every response the agent emits today — that is the
 * INTENDED state, costing one failed regex per turn. The day the structured
 * trailer is agreed the agent starts emitting it, `via` flips from 'heuristic'
 * to 'trailer' in our logs, and the cutover is observable rather than deployed,
 * with zero code change on our side.
